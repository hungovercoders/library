name: hc-recording
description: Capture and embed behavioural terminal recordings (vhs / asciinema) for hungovercoders tutorial lessons and launch posts — tooling, asset paths, file-size budgets, embed templates
allowed-tools: Read, Bash
---

Capture *behaviour over time* — the moments a static screenshot can't carry. A hook firing on a bad write, three subagents fanning out in parallel, an auto-mode run end-to-end. Where `hc-screenshot` is for stills, `hc-recording` is for motion: `vhs` (declarative, reproducible) primary; `asciinema` + `agg` fallback for real authenticated sessions.

> **Note:** lifted into the library from `learn.claude-code/CAPTURE-GUIDE.md` (where it was unused and orphaned). The lesson-by-lesson recording targets at the bottom are still claude-code-specific — that section will be split out / genericised in a later refinement pass.

## Recording tool — pick one

**Primary: `vhs` (Charm)** — declarative scripts you commit alongside the assets they produce. One-line install:

```bash
brew install vhs        # macOS
# or download from https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs/releases for Linux
```

A `recordings/<name>.tape` script is just a small DSL describing the terminal session. Run `vhs recordings/audit-fanout.tape` and it produces `recordings/audit-fanout.gif` (or `.mp4` / `.webm` — vhs supports all three). Reproducible, version-controllable, no live keystrokes during recording.

**Fallback: `asciinema` + `agg`** — for moments where vhs's headless terminal can't simulate the real session (e.g. capturing a real `claude` session with auth, MCP, the works):

```bash
brew install asciinema
brew install agg              # asciinema-to-GIF converter

asciinema rec session.cast    # records a real terminal session
agg session.cast session.gif  # converts to GIF
```

## Where the assets live

Drop recordings here:

```
site/public/assets/training/<series>/<lesson-slug>/<name>.{gif,mp4,webm}
```

So a recording of the lesson-10 hook firing in the claude-code series lives at:

```
site/public/assets/training/claude-code/10-hooks/hook-blocks-bad-write.mp4
```

For launch posts, the path follows the post-slug convention (mirrors `hc-screenshot`):

```
site/public/assets/<YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug>/<name>.{gif,mp4,webm}
```

The lesson markdown references it as an absolute site path:

```markdown
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="lesson-recording">
  <source src="/assets/training/<series>/<lesson>/<name>.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="/assets/training/<series>/<lesson>/<name>.webm" type="video/webm">
  <img src="/assets/training/<series>/<lesson>/<name>.gif" alt="One sentence describing what the recording shows — the behaviour, the outcome, the proof. Not 'recording of terminal'.">
</video>
```

The `<video>` tag is preferred (smaller files at the same quality, looped, autoplay-safe with `muted`). The `<img>` fallback inside picks up if a browser doesn't support inline video.

## Naming convention

- Lowercase kebab-case for the filename
- Describe the *outcome* not the *input*: `hook-blocks-bad-write.mp4` beats `add-film-yelling-mood.mp4`
- Pair file: every `.mp4` ships alongside a `.webm` (better Cloudflare compression) and a `.gif` (the universal fallback)

Generate the trio from one source recording with ffmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart hook-blocks-bad-write.mp4
ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 hook-blocks-bad-write.webm
ffmpeg -i source.mov -vf "fps=12,scale=720:-1:flags=lanczos" -loop 0 hook-blocks-bad-write.gif
```

## File-size budget

| Format | Target | Hard cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MP4 | < 200KB for 4–8 sec | 500KB |
| WebM | < 150KB | 350KB |
| GIF | < 500KB | 1MB |

Behavioural recordings are the most expensive asset per lesson — keep them honest.

## Commit and reference

Once a recording is in `site/public/assets/training/<series>/<lesson-slug>/`:

1. Add the `<video>` markdown to the lesson README at the marked drop-point
2. Commit the asset + the markdown together (`git add site/public/assets/...` *and* the relevant `docs/<lesson>/README.md`)
3. `npm run build` from `site/` to confirm it deploys (the recording must end up under `dist/client/assets/...` per the Cloudflare Workers deploy gotcha in `site/AGENTS.md`)
4. Push and the Cloudflare preview will render the embedded video

## Per-lesson recording targets — learn.claude-code (legacy content, to be moved)

The ten claude-code-specific recording targets below were drafted before any recording was actually made. They name lessons, prompt sequences, and expected durations specific to that series. **This block belongs back inside `learn.claude-code/` as a per-series recording plan**, with the library skill above pointing only at the generic convention. Splitting it out is a follow-up task.

### 1. Lesson 10 — hook blocks a bad write (highest value)

- **Drop into:** `docs/10-hooks/README.md`, after the "Proving the Bouncer Works" section
- **State:** cinema has `films.json` + `pick-film.sh` + project `.claude/settings.json` with the films-validate hook wired
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /add-film "Bad" 999 BIG 10000
  ```
- **What to capture:** the agent calling `Edit` on films.json, the PostToolUse hook firing, the stderr feedback ("films.json failed schema check: row X year 999 not in range, mood not single lowercase word, runtime > 240"), the agent reading the feedback and proposing a corrected row
- **Duration:** 5–7 seconds
- **File:** `10-hooks/hook-blocks-bad-write.mp4`

### 2. Lesson 11 — /audit spawns three subagents in parallel

- **Drop into:** `docs/11-subagents-task-tool/README.md`, after the worked example of the `/audit` skill
- **State:** cinema has the audit skill; films.json has a planted duplicate, a mood-drift row, and a malformed entry
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /audit
  ```
- **What to capture:** the three Task tool calls appearing in parallel, each subagent's progress lines, the final unified report assembling
- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **File:** `11-subagents-task-tool/audit-fanout.mp4`

### 3. Lesson 14 — auto-mode runs the whole cage

- **Drop into:** `docs/14-putting-it-together-auto-mode/README.md`, in "Step 4 — Auto-Mode, Two Postures at Once"
- **State:** full cinema kit installed; on `feat/automode-demo` branch in a worktree
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  $ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
  > Plan and implement: support a new mood "stormy" by adding three films for it, and run /audit to verify catalogue hygiene afterwards.
  ```
- **What to capture:** plan written, edits applied to films.json with the hook silently approving each, audit fanning out, final summary. Bonus shot: try forcing the agent into a deny situation (`rm films.json`) — show the deny rule blocking
- **Duration:** 15–25 seconds (this one earns the length; it's the climax)
- **File:** `14-putting-it-together-auto-mode/auto-mode-full-run.mp4`

### 4. Lesson 5 — deny rule blocks an `rm`

- **Drop into:** `docs/05-permission-modes/README.md`, after "The First Cinema Config"
- **State:** cinema's project `.claude/settings.json` has `deny: ["Bash(rm:*)"]`
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > Could you remove the films.json file so we can start over?
  ```
- **What to capture:** the agent's `Bash(rm films.json)` attempt, the permission denial with the source file reference, the agent suggesting an alternative
- **Duration:** 4–5 seconds
- **File:** `05-permission-modes/deny-blocks-rm.mp4`

### 5. Lesson 7 — plan mode refusing to edit

- **Drop into:** `docs/07-plan-mode/README.md`, after the "Reading is Free" section
- **State:** cinema in plan mode (started with `claude --permission-mode plan`)
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > Add a new field "rating" to films.json with a default of null
  ```
- **What to capture:** the agent describing what it *would* do, the explicit refusal to Edit, the ExitPlanMode confirmation flow
- **Duration:** 5–8 seconds
- **File:** `07-plan-mode/plan-mode-refuses-edit.mp4`

### 6. Lesson 13 — MCP SQL query against the cinema

- **Drop into:** `docs/13-mcp-servers/README.md`, in the "Using It" section
- **State:** cinema.db built; .mcp.json loaded; full cinema seed
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > Which mood currently has the fewest films, and what's the average runtime?
  ```
- **What to capture:** the MCP tool call `mcp__cinema-db__read_query`, the SQL emitted, the result, the English answer
- **Duration:** 6–8 seconds
- **File:** `13-mcp-servers/mcp-sql-query.mp4`

### 7. Lesson 12 — `/compact` recovering window

- **Drop into:** `docs/12-context-and-cost/README.md`, in the `/compact` section
- **State:** session intentionally pushed past 75% — read every lesson README in sequence to get there
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /context
  > /compact
  > /context
  ```
- **What to capture:** the before/after window percentages; the "kept X% of original message tokens" line
- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **File:** `12-context-and-cost/compact-recovers-window.mp4`

### 8. Lesson 9 — `/add-film` skill + hook composition

- **Drop into:** `docs/09-skills/README.md`, after the `/add-film` first-fire example
- **State:** cinema seed; project settings + films-validate hook in place
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /add-film "Pride" 2014 wales 119
  ```
- **What to capture:** skill prompt parses args, agent Edits films.json, PostToolUse hook fires silently (no visible failure), control returns to user
- **Duration:** 4–6 seconds
- **File:** `09-skills/add-film-composes-with-hook.mp4`

### 9. Lesson 8 — custom slash command running

- **Drop into:** `docs/08-custom-slash-commands/README.md`, after introducing `/film-suggest`
- **State:** cinema with CLAUDE.md + the two slash commands wired
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /film-suggest "knackered Tuesday"
  ```
- **What to capture:** the agent reasoning through the catalogue with the CLAUDE.md conventions in mind, the recommendation (Twin Town or similar), the brief rationale paragraph
- **Duration:** 5–7 seconds
- **File:** `08-custom-slash-commands/film-suggest.mp4`

### 10. Launch blog — three features compose in one keystroke

- **Drop into:** `site/src/content/blog/2026-05-25-building-a-film-picker-with-claude-code.md`, in the "Lights Up — Running the Kit" section
- **State:** the blog's twenty-minute kit (films.json + pick-film.sh + CLAUDE.md + add-film skill + validate-json hook user-level)
- **Sequence:**
  ```text
  > /add-film "Pride" 2014 wales 119
  $ ./pick-film.sh wales
  ```
- **What to capture:** the three-feature composition end-to-end. This is the appetiser proof — readers who watch this commit to the full series
- **Duration:** 6–8 seconds
- **File:** in the site repo at `site/public/assets/blog/2026-05-25-building-a-film-picker-with-claude-code/kit-in-action.mp4`

## When the architectural SVGs are enough

The series ships five inline SVGs (cage stack, kit composition, subagent isolation, settings hierarchy, `/context` output mockup) covering *structural* claims — "this is what the kit is shaped like", "this is how the cage layers stack". Those don't change between sessions and don't need a real recording.

The ten moments above are the *behavioural* claims — "the hook actually fires", "the subagents actually run in parallel", "auto-mode actually works because of the cage". Those need real recordings because the value is *seeing the behaviour unfold*, not the snapshot.

Work through the list in priority order — even just the top 3 (hook block, audit fanout, auto-mode capstone) would close the biggest "I'd need to see it to believe it" gaps in the series.
